# Prework Study Guide

## Description
A quick reference tool for me to use. I should come here if I forgot how something works or need guidance on my work.
## Installation
N/A
## Usage
I can use this tool as a way for me to look at how different coding languages are implmented for a project. I should be able to see how they are all intertwined with eachother which would help in the future when I look back on this. HTML is like the bones of a webpage. It is the structure that holds stuff inside of it which are the other coding languages such as CSS and JavaScript.
CSS adds style to your website JavaScript adds complexity and interactivty to websites. Git is like the brain that connects all of the changes made in other branches to the main hub.
